_A Genetic Algorithm to Reduce Marginalization in Social Networks_

## What is marginalization?
**_Discrimination in the literature_:** In a network, algorithmic discrimination focuses on the possible discrimination arising from an individual’s network position, whereas the Data Mining field proposes that in a fair dataset similar individuals should be treated similarly.

**_Discrimination as marginalization:_** Marginalization is defined as the act of relegating someone or something to an unimportant position, and can indeed occur between different groups (e.g.,  a non-white person marginalised by white people) or inside of the same group (e.g., a white person marginalised by other white people). In a fair network, all nodes should be surrounded by a group of peers that manifests a similar distribution with respect to an attribute. Additionally, such distribution should be representative of the label distribution in the whole system. A proportionally-different distribution implies some sort of marginalization against the node – either by nodes with different labels or by those with the same label. 

## Our proposal to quantify marginalization

In our work, we introduce _**Individual Marginalization Score**_ (IMS), a measure that takes into account the attribute distribution in the node’s neighbourhood and compares it to the distribution in the whole network. IMS ranges in [-1, 1] and describes:
- marginalization perpetrated by nodes with the same attribute for IMS < 0;
- marginalization perpetrated by nodes with a different attribute for IMS > 0;
- no marginalization for IMS = 0. 

A node can be considered marginalised if its absolute IMS is beyond a fixed threshold. The number of marginalised nodes can quantify marginalization at the macro-scale level scale. We also the introduce the _**System Marginalization Score**_ (SMS), which captures the average marginalization for all nodes, regardless of the sign.

## Our proposal to reduce marginalization

Our algorithm finds a combination of edges to be added that minimises the number of marginalised nodes with relatively limited modifications to the network, assuming either a either a global point of view (that of an external entity that is aware of the marginalization of all individuals e.g., a recommendation system) or a local one (i.e., that of individuals that wish to overcome their marginalised status). Edges are selected following the triadic closure principle (e.g., we assume that a non-existing edge that would close 10 triangles is more likely to appear than one that would close 2 triangles).

Plausible edges are then encoded in a binary vector. Starting from such a vector, a genetic algorithm tries to either minimise the SMS or the number of marginalised nodes. If equal solutions are found, the one with fewer interventions is prioritised.

This repository contains a simple template to exemplify: how to structure a python project and leverage GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish it as a python package (to PyPI and Conda).

The template project describes a simple Python package containing an object class, an object container ad a few functions to sort them and convert from/to JSON.

The template comes with:
- a few GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish the package to PyPI (and Conda) when a new release is created (or on demand);
- a GitHub Action to check the code quality using CodeQL;
- a GitHub Action to check compliance with Black code style;
- a few tests to exemplify the use of pytest;
- a minimal sphinx documentation to exemplify the use of sphinx and readthedocs;
- a minimal configuration files to exemplify the use of gitignore and coveragerc;
- a minimal setup.py to exemplify the use of setuptools.
